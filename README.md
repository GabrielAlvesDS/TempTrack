## Objective
This project aims to deepen knowledge in time series analysis and explore new algorithms. Two models were developed to predict hourly temperature over a year using Prophet and XGBoost. The goal is to assess the usability of each model and identify which one performs better.

The choice of a one-year period with hourly predictions was made to allow the models to capture seasonal variations throughout the year.


## Data Set
The data used in this project were extracted from the complete historical records of INMET for the region of Seropédica, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where EMBRAPA is located. This data set includes various climate measurements recorded hourly since 2002. For this project, we exclusively used the variable 'TEMPERATURA DO AR - BULBO SECO, HORÁRIA (°C)', which provided a robust base for training the models. Below is a sample of the data used:
